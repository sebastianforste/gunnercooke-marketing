This standalone file delivers the key insights from Geoff Smart and Randy Street’s Who: The A Method for Hiring up to (but not including) the first interview, focusing on the Scorecard and Source steps that set up the Select stage where the initial screening interview begins [1][2][3][4]. The content here explains the problem Who solves, defines A Players, codifies the Scorecard, and operationalizes proactive sourcing so that your pipeline is strong before any interviews take place [3][5][6].

### Why hiring is the #1 problem
Who frames hiring as the central lever for organizational performance because no strategy persists without the right people to execute it, making “who decisions” foundational to all subsequent “what decisions” in the business [3][2]. The authors emphasize that most companies rely on inconsistent, intuition-heavy methods that lead to costly mis-hires, arguing for a systematic approach that measurably increases the odds of putting A Players into critical roles [3][7].

### The A Method overview
The A Method organizes hiring into four steps—Scorecard, Source, Select, and Sell—to reduce variance and increase signal at each stage of the funnel, creating a repeatable process that scales across levels and functions [2][5]. Up to the first interview, the relevant steps are Scorecard (define success and fit) and Source (build a proactive pipeline), which together ensure that when interviews begin, you are already evaluating strong, aligned candidates [3][4].

### A Player definition
An A Player is defined as someone who has at least a 90% chance of achieving a set of outcomes that only the top 10% of possible candidates could achieve in that role and context, tying performance expectations directly to measurable results rather than generic traits [3]. This definition reinforces that hiring is about probability-weighted outcomes relative to your Scorecard, not celebrity resumes or vague notions of talent divorced from the work to be done [3][5].

### Four root causes of hiring failure
The book attributes most hiring failures to four mistakes: lack of clarity about the job, lack of compelling candidates, inability to select the right person, and failure to close the preferred candidate, each of which maps to the four steps in the A Method [3]. The authors also catalog “voodoo hiring methods,” such as gut-feel interviews and leading questions, which produce unreliable signals and should be replaced with structured approaches anchored in the Scorecard and evidence-based assessment later in the process [3][7].

### What is covered before the first interview
Before the Select stage begins, the work is to build a rigorous Scorecard and a proactive sourcing system, so interviewers are aligned on what “great” looks like and the pipeline is populated with candidates who plausibly match those standards [3][5]. This front-loading of clarity and channel strategy saves time in selection, reduces noise, and improves close rates because candidates have been engaged on a true opportunity, not a generic posting [3][6].

### What “first interview” means in Who
In the A Method, the Select step consists of a sequence of structured interviews—the Screening Interview, the Who Interview, Focused Interviews, and Reference Interviews—with the Screening Interview serving as the first interview gate, which is outside the scope of this file by your instruction [2][4]. Everything below prepares you to hand high-signal candidates into that first screening conversation with strong alignment and momentum, without describing the interview content itself [3][2].

### Scorecard: the blueprint for success
The Scorecard replaces job descriptions with a measurement instrument that defines the mission of the role, the specific outcomes to be achieved, and the competencies required to deliver those outcomes in your environment [5][3]. This shift from tasks to results ensures that selection and sourcing are anchored in what success looks like 12–18 months ahead, rather than a historical list of duties [5][8].

### Why job descriptions fail
Traditional job descriptions emphasize responsibilities and years of experience, which correlate weakly with outcomes and invite bias toward familiar biographies instead of evidence of performance against relevant goals [3][7]. By contrast, the Scorecard translates strategy into clear expectations that can be probed in history, tested in evidence, and later validated in references, aligning all stakeholders on what matters most [5][3].

### The three components of a Scorecard
A complete Scorecard contains a mission statement (the role’s core purpose), 3–8 measurable outcomes (what must be achieved), and a set of competencies (skills and behaviors) that predictably enable those outcomes in your context [5][9]. Keeping the outcomes concise and prioritized improves focus and interview consistency, while competencies provide the behavioral texture to evaluate how work actually gets done [5][8].

### Mission: the role’s purpose
The mission statement should clearly and concisely state why the role exists and how it contributes to the organization’s strategy, avoiding vague labels or rehashed job titles [5]. Clarity here acts as a north star for both the hire and the interviewers by centering discussions on purpose and value rather than a diffuse set of activities [5][3].

### Outcomes: measurable success
List 3–8 specific results that define success, such as revenue targets, product milestones, process improvements, or capability builds, and rank them by importance to guide trade-offs and evaluation [9][5]. The authors recommend concrete metrics and time frames so that later interviews and reference checks can validate whether similar results were achieved in comparable contexts [5][3].

### Competencies: how the work gets done
Competencies describe the observable skills and behaviors that enable outcomes—such as analytical rigor, team leadership, resourcefulness, or follow-through—so interviewers can probe for “how” not just “what” [5][8]. These should be job-relevant and tied to the outcomes rather than generic personality descriptors, because the goal is to predict execution in a particular role and environment [5][3].

### Cultural alignment without ambiguity
Who emphasizes cultural alignment as an expression of competencies and values calibrated to your organization’s reality, avoiding the vague “culture fit” shorthand that can mask bias or drift from outcomes [5][3]. The Scorecard thus becomes both a performance contract and a values filter, enabling consistent, job-related assessments across candidates [5][7].

### Aligning stakeholders around the Scorecard
Before sourcing begins, share and finalize the Scorecard with all decision-makers so that everyone evaluates candidates against the same mission, outcomes, and competencies, reducing downstream disagreement and recalibration [5][3]. This alignment step is essential to avoid moving goalposts mid-funnel and to streamline later decision-making when multiple finalists are under consideration [5][7].

### Example Scorecard structure
A practical structure includes a one-sentence mission (e.g., “Own and scale new ARR to €3M by year-end through ICP-focused pipeline and improved win rates”), 5–7 outcomes with metrics and timeframes, and 6–8 competencies with brief definitions tied to the work [5][9]. Keeping the structure lean enforces focus and makes it easier to construct interview questions and reference probes that map cleanly to the defined success profile [5][8].

### Common Scorecard pitfalls
Typical mistakes include listing tasks instead of outcomes, stuffing in too many competencies, and writing vague missions that could apply to any company, all of which dilute predictive value and create selection noise [3][5]. Another frequent error is misalignment between the role’s seniority and the outcomes, such as asking an IC to deliver executive-level changes without the necessary scope or support, which the Scorecard should surface early [5][3].

### Calibrating scope and stage
Ensure the Scorecard reflects company stage and role scope, since the competencies and outcomes for a builder in an early-stage environment differ from those of an optimizer in a mature organization even if titles are similar [5][3]. This calibration helps source from analogous contexts and improves portability of success by matching work realities rather than labels [5][7].

### Using the Scorecard to guide sourcing
Sourcing should be driven directly from the Scorecard, translating outcomes and competencies into search criteria, target company lists, and outreach messages that speak to the real challenge and impact of the role [5][3]. This keeps the funnel tight and reduces time spent on candidates whose backgrounds or behaviors do not plausibly map to the defined success profile [5][6].

### Source: generating a flow of A Players
The Source step replaces “post and pray” with a proactive, ongoing pipeline that emphasizes known networks, referrals, and discipline in mapping and outreach so that A Players are known before roles open [6][5]. The authors argue that systematic sourcing ahead of need is the most reliable way to ensure consistent access to top talent who are often passive and not browsing job boards [6][3].

### Sourcing as a leadership responsibility
Leaders are encouraged to treat sourcing as a core part of the job and to maintain a bench of prospective A Players, which both speeds hiring and improves fit because relationships predate the open requisition [6][5]. This mindset shift turns sporadic hiring into a steady-state talent acquisition system that compounds over time [6][3].

### The “10 people you know” exercise
Within workshops on the A Method, participants practice listing 10 people they know who might be A Players for current or future needs, using this to kickstart referrals and warm introductions rather than relying on cold posting [4]. This exercise forms the backbone of a referral-first approach that typically yields higher quality and faster cycles than purely inbound channels [4][3].

### Referrals as the highest-signal channel
A Players tend to know and attract other A Players, making referrals from trusted employees and leaders a high-yield source that reduces variance and accelerates trust-building [3][5]. The Source step encourages making referral generation a recurring habit, including regular asks and follow-ups to turn networks into a consistent pipeline rather than ad hoc contributions [3][6].

### Proactive mapping and longlists
Use the Scorecard to generate a targeted longlist of companies and roles where the required outcomes and competencies are plausibly cultivated, which increases the odds of portability and success [5][3]. This mapping allows tailored outreach that references the candidate’s context and links their prior impact to the mission and outcomes in your Scorecard [5][6].

### Crafting outreach that resonates
Outreach should speak directly to the mission and outcomes of the role, positioning the opportunity as a substantive challenge with measurable impact that matches an A Player’s motivations and history [3][5]. Generic mass emails and laundry lists of responsibilities tend to repel A Players, whereas specific, outcome-based invitations increase response and engagement [3][6].

### Making sourcing continuous
The authors advocate maintaining the pipeline even when headcount is not immediately open, since relationships built over time increase response rates, trust, and close probability when roles do become available [6][5]. Continuous sourcing also smooths hiring velocity and reduces the risk of settling for convenience when timelines are tight [6][3].

### Assigning sourcing outcomes
One practical tactic is to add explicit sourcing outcomes to leaders’ Scorecards—such as committing to identify and cultivate a set number of A Player leads per quarter—so talent building becomes measurable work, not a vague intention [10]. Treating sourcing as an outcome aligns incentives and normalizes leadership involvement in talent pipelines [10][5].

### Avoiding voodoo sourcing
“Voodoo” approaches at the sourcing stage include open-ended postings without a Scorecard, chasing brand-name résumés without context mapping, and hoping that inbound activity will surface A Players, all of which are discouraged [3]. The Source step insists on disciplined, relationship-led outreach aligned to the Scorecard, with referrals and known networks prioritized over anonymous applications [3][5].

### When to start the Select stage
Begin the Select stage only after confirming that prospects in the pipeline plausibly map to the Scorecard’s mission, outcomes, and competencies, ensuring that interviews gather data against the right profile rather than recalibrating on the fly [3][5]. This readiness check preserves candidate experience and team time by reducing the number of interviews spent on poor fits [3][7].

### Hand-off to the first interview
In the A Method, the first interview in Select is the Screening Interview, a short conversation designed to test basic fit against the Scorecard and to decide whether to proceed to deeper assessment, which this document does not cover by design [4][2]. Treat the hand-off point as a quality gate, not a scheduling milestone, so that selection energy is focused on serious, high-signal candidates [2][3].

### Pre-interview candidate experience
Candidate experience begins in sourcing, where responsiveness, clarity, and authenticity set the tone for later conversations and affect close rates in the Sell step [3][5]. Communicating the mission, outcomes, and bar upfront builds trust with A Players who evaluate rigor and seriousness from the first touch [3][6].

### Scorecard-to-sourcing workflow
A simple pre-interview workflow is: finalize the Scorecard, align stakeholders, produce a target map of companies and roles, generate a longlist of prospects, run the “10 people you know” pass for referrals, and launch personalized outreach [5][4]. As responses arrive, gate candidates against the Scorecard to ensure only plausible A Players advance to interviews [3][5].

### Checklist: ready to interview
- Scorecard finalized with mission, outcomes, and competencies, and shared with all interviewers [5][3].  
- Sourcing channels activated with a referral-first approach and target mapping complete [6][5].  
- Outreach copy aligned to the Scorecard and calibrated to A Player motivations [3][5].  
- Prospects triaged for plausible fit before scheduling any interviews [3][7].

### Sample Scorecard template
- Mission: A one-sentence statement of role purpose and strategic contribution, written in plain language and tied to value creation [5].  
- Outcomes: 3–8 measurable results with time frames, ranked by importance, each with a clear metric and ownership [9][5].  
- Competencies: Job-relevant skills and behaviors linked to the outcomes, described in observable terms to support structured assessment later [5][8].

### Example Scorecard language
Mission: “Own and scale our DACH enterprise pipeline to €3M new ARR in 12 months by focusing on ICP accounts and raising win rate from 18% to 28%” [5]. Outcomes: “Build €7M qualified pipeline by Q3; close €3M new ARR by Q4; reduce cycle time by 20%; establish quarterly account plans for top 50 ICPs; hire and onboard 2 AEs by Q2” [9]. Competencies: “Analytical rigor; Enterprise sales process leadership; Resourcefulness; Team collaboration; Follow-through; Communication that influences” with 1–2 sentences each describing observable behaviors tied to results [5][8].

### Governance and iteration
Treat the Scorecard as a living document that can be refined between searches as strategy evolves, while maintaining stability during a given search to avoid confusing candidates and interviewers [5][3]. After each hire, review whether the Scorecard predicted success and update definitions or metrics accordingly to improve future predictive power [5][7].

### Sourcing cadence and accountability
Establish a weekly or biweekly sourcing cadence for leaders that includes referral asks, outreach follow-ups, and pipeline review, so progress compounds and accountability is visible [6][5]. Making this a recurring management rhythm institutionalizes the Source step and reduces time-to-fill without sacrificing quality [6][3].

### Integrating employer brand with Invitations
Although Who focuses on the mechanics of Scorecards and sourcing, the same principles suggest positioning the opportunity in outreach through the mission and outcomes rather than generic benefits, which resonates with A Players seeking impact [3][5]. Authentic, outcome-centric messaging attracts candidates who self-identify with the specific challenge, improving initial fit before any interviews occur [3][6].

### Avoiding misalignment traps
Common traps include launching sourcing with an unfinished Scorecard, allowing multiple versions of success to circulate among stakeholders, and tolerating one-off exceptions that erode process integrity [3][5]. Closing these gaps before interviews saves significant time and preserves candidate confidence in the company’s decision quality [3][7].

### The economics of doing it right
By increasing the probability of A Player hires, organizations reduce backfill costs, ramp faster, and realize outsized impact per head, which is the strategic payoff of disciplined Scorecard and Source execution [3][7]. The method’s goal is not perfection but a repeatable lift in hiring accuracy that compounds across dozens of decisions each year [3][5].

### Preparing interview teams without content
Even without discussing interview content, teams can prepare by reviewing the Scorecard, rehearsing how to map evidence to outcomes and competencies, and agreeing on the gating logic for advancing candidates after the first interview [5][3]. This pre-work ensures the initial screening conversation stays tightly coupled to the Scorecard and reduces subjectivity in early decisions [5][7].

### Role families and scaling searches
For multiple similar roles, create a core Scorecard for the role family with shared mission and competencies, then adjust outcomes and scope by level to accelerate sourcing while keeping standards consistent [5][3]. This approach supports growth without diluting the clarity that makes later selection effective [5][7].

### Signs you are ready to proceed
You are ready to schedule first interviews when your pipeline is primarily referral or directly sourced candidates who can plausibly hit the Scorecard’s outcomes, and all interviewers can articulate the mission and top three outcomes from memory [3][5]. Reaching this threshold before interviews begin increases yield and shortens cycle time in the Select stage [3][7].

### Minimal viable artifacts
Have the finalized Scorecard, a target company map, a shared candidate tracker annotated against Scorecard dimensions, and outreach templates tied to the mission and outcomes so the process runs smoothly [5][3]. These artifacts keep everyone synchronized and make it easier to maintain quality under time pressure [5][6].

### What to exclude at this stage
Avoid drafting interview questions or grading rubrics before the Scorecard is locked, and avoid launching reference checks or work samples prior to validating basic fit via the first interview in Select, which sits outside this scope [2][3]. Staying sequenced prevents wasted effort and mixed signals to candidates [2][5].

### Recap of pre-interview transformation
- From job descriptions to Scorecards that define mission, outcomes, and competencies [5][3].  
- From “post and pray” to proactive, referral-first sourcing that builds a bench ahead of need [6][5].  
- From stakeholder ambiguity to aligned, evidence-ready hiring teams anchored in the same definition of success [5][7].  
- From resume chasing to outcome- and behavior-driven targeting based on portability and context [5][3].

### Transition to the first interview
With Scorecard and Source complete, the Select stage begins with the Screening Interview, which is the first interview designed to quickly test fit against the Scorecard before investing in deeper assessment, and is beyond the defined scope here [4][2]. Proceed when your pipeline composition and internal alignment meet the readiness criteria above [3][5].
