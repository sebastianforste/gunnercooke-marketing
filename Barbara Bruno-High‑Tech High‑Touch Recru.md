Barbara Bruno-High‑Tech High‑Touch Recruiting up to the point where interviews begin, focusing on process design, requisitions, performance objectives, candidate experience, sourcing, and outreach before any phone screens or interviews take place [1][2]. It intentionally excludes the book’s interview mechanics (including the 9‑step phone or screening interview) and stops at the “ready to interview” gate while noting those resources exist in the book’s toolkit [3][4].

### Scope and cutoff
This file covers the book’s pre‑interview foundations: updating the hiring process, writing effective requisitions and performance objectives, designing candidate experience, aligning with hiring managers, calibrating titles, and activating high‑tech and high‑touch sourcing before the first interview is scheduled [2][5]. The book includes online tools like an interview scorecard and a 9‑step telephone interview guide, but those procedures are beyond this summary’s boundary and are only acknowledged as forthcoming material in the text [3][6].

### Premise and context
Bruno’s thesis is that high‑tech tools surface candidates, but only high‑touch human practices convert them into successful hires who stay beyond the first months, which is critical given high early attrition after start dates in many markets [1][7]. The book’s aim is an end‑to‑end system that blends automation with relationship‑centric recruiting to raise long‑term quality of hire and reduce preventable early churn [4][3].

### Why high‑touch matters
Relying solely on automated outreach and transactional steps degrades trust and response rates, whereas human connection, clarity, and responsiveness meaningfully influence candidate engagement and acceptance quality later in the funnel [4][1]. High‑touch practices are framed as the differentiator that converts high‑tech visibility into durable hiring outcomes and retention [3][8].

### Where interviews begin (not covered)
The book provides tools such as an interview scorecard and guidelines for a 9‑step telephone interview, which mark the beginning of structured interview stages and are used after the pre‑interview prep is complete [3][6]. This summary stops just before those steps and focuses on everything teams should have ready before dialing a candidate for the first structured conversation [4][7].

### Start by fixing the process
Bruno opens with a call to update the hiring process itself—treat recruiting as a designed journey that blends tech and human touch rather than a reactive sequence of tasks [2][9]. A modernized process reduces early attrition and improves candidate satisfaction by eliminating friction points and clarifying expectations across stakeholders [2][4].

### Role definitions and performance objectives
Instead of generic job descriptions, define success with concrete performance objectives tied to time frames and measurable outcomes so that every later step maps to what the hire must achieve [5][4]. The book’s tables highlight “Eight steps to writing performance objectives,” signaling a structured approach leaders can apply before any sourcing begins [5][9].

### Job requisition clarity
A strong requisition captures mission, scope, outcomes, constraints, and must‑have competencies, aligning decision‑makers and informing every piece of candidate‑facing content to follow [5][8]. The book includes a “Job requisition example” to standardize this artifact and reduce changes mid‑search that erode candidate trust [5][3].

### Titles as market signals
Creative and accurate titles increase discoverability and set expectations for accountability and seniority, which affects response quality and the perceived importance of the role [5][8]. The presence of “Creative job titles” in the book’s tables underscores the need to use titles strategically rather than defaulting to internal shorthand that confuses candidates [5][4].

### Candidate experience foundations
Candidate experience begins before any interview through application friction, clarity of timelines, responsiveness, and authenticity of communications, and it heavily influences both engagement and offer acceptance odds [1][8]. Bruno’s premise is that high‑touch behaviors at this stage create compounding goodwill that translates into smoother selection and stronger close rates later [4][3].

### Blend high‑tech with high‑touch
Use AI‑powered tools and search platforms to scale discovery, then switch to human‑led conversations and personalized outreach to establish trust and evaluate mutual fit [1][10]. The book repeatedly cautions against over‑reliance on text and email chains without real conversation, which can miss nuance and degrade candidate confidence [7][4].

### Hiring‑manager partnership
Recruiters and hiring managers must co‑own outcomes, co‑create the requisition and performance objectives, and show up visibly to candidates to avoid avoidable drop‑off and misalignment [2][8]. The book positions manager engagement as non‑negotiable because candidate experience and decision speed are leadership signals that shape market response [1][3].

### Intake as a strategy session
Bruno treats intake as strategic planning rather than administrative intake, surfacing risk on compensation, location, timing, and must‑haves versus nice‑to‑haves before a single message is sent [2][8]. A shared plan emerging from intake sets service‑level expectations for response times, interview availability, and decision authority, which stabilizes later stages [2][9].

### Writing human‑first role narratives
Publish candidate‑centric role narratives that lead with the mission, problems to solve, and success in year one, not just lists of responsibilities or rigid years‑of‑experience gates [8][1]. Clear language, inclusive phrasing, and concrete outcomes differentiate postings and invitations from generic ATS‑shaped descriptions [4][3].

### Channel strategy before interviews
Shift top‑of‑funnel activity toward referrals, targeted outbound, and community presence while still leveraging job boards for visibility where relevant to the talent pool [8][4]. High‑tech search helps build precise longlists, but high‑touch referrals and warm introductions usually deliver better quality and speed for critical roles [1][3].

### Employer brand signals that matter
Candidates triangulate truth from public artifacts—employee voices, leadership presence, and how the company talks about work—and will self‑select based on perceived authenticity [1][4]. Ensuring consistency between public signals and recruiter messaging reduces skepticism and improves engagement rates during outreach [8][3].

### Outreach that earns replies
Personalized invitations that connect a candidate’s visible impact to the role’s outcomes outperform templated blasts and reinforce the high‑touch standard the book advocates [1][4]. The goal is to invite a real conversation, not to transact a screening, so tone, specificity, and clarity about next steps are emphasized [8][3].

### Application friction and SLAs
Minimize redundant forms, clarify timelines, and enforce SLAs for response and feedback so the first impression is operational excellence rather than bureaucracy or silence [1][8]. This upfront discipline prevents self‑deselection by strong candidates who have options and little patience for poor process signals [4][3].

### Pre‑interview artifacts to finalize
Before scheduling interviews, finalize the requisition, performance objectives, candidate‑facing role narrative, sourcing plan, and internal SLAs for responsiveness and scheduling windows [5][2]. Having these artifacts ready creates consistency across messages and accelerates flow once interviews begin [9][8].

### Metrics to monitor early
Track response rates to personalized outreach, referral contribution to pipeline, time‑to‑first‑response, and drop‑off across application steps to detect friction before interviews [1][8]. These pre‑interview metrics correlate with downstream acceptance rates and provide early warnings about process gaps [4][3].

### Governance and decision roles
Clarify who drafts and approves performance objectives, who owns candidate communication, and who has final decision authority to avoid mid‑funnel contradictions that erode trust [2][9]. Clear governance also reduces cycle time, which candidates interpret as a proxy for organizational competence [1][8].

### Avoid common traps
Do not launch outreach with a vague or conflicting brief, do not rely solely on automated messaging, and do not postpone hiring‑manager visibility until late stages [4][1]. These patterns increase noise, lengthen cycles, and lead to mis‑hires or declined offers by high‑caliber candidates [8][3].

### Pre‑interview checklist
- Requisition and performance objectives are complete, specific, and agreed by stakeholders [5][2].  
- Candidate‑facing narrative emphasizes mission, problems to solve, and success metrics in year one [8][1].  
- Sourcing plan prioritizes referrals and targeted outreach, supported by high‑tech discovery tools [1][8].  
- SLAs for response and scheduling are set, visible, and owned by recruiters and hiring managers [2][9].  
- Outreach templates are personalized and aligned to role outcomes and manager’s voice [8][1].

### Example pre‑interview workflow
Begin with a strategy intake to align scope and constraints, draft the requisition and performance objectives, and review for clarity and realism with decision‑makers before publishing anything [2][5]. Build a target map and referral list, launch personalized outreach, and monitor early funnel metrics to verify readiness before scheduling the first call [1][8].

### High‑tech enablement, not replacement
Use platforms and AI to expand the candidate universe and automate low‑value steps, then invest each freed minute in high‑touch actions like thoughtful messages and timely calls [1][10]. The book frames tools as a multiplier of human attention, not a substitute for it [4][3].

### Early retention starts pre‑interview
Candidates who feel respected, informed, and connected to the mission during early stages are more likely to engage deeply, accept offers, and remain engaged after starting [4][1]. Bruno ties improved early retention to the same high‑touch design that drives better recruiting outcomes [3][8].

### Evidence and resources
The publisher materials and book listings emphasize that the system spans every stage of recruiting and includes downloadable templates like requisitions, scorecards, and the 9‑step phone interview guide for later use [3][7]. Those resources should be deployed only after the pre‑interview foundations here are complete to preserve sequence and quality [4][6].

### Advanced considerations
Consider experimenting with creative titles validated by the book’s examples to improve discoverability without misrepresenting scope or seniority [5][8]. Use the “Eight steps to writing performance objectives” as a post‑mortem tool after each hire to tune clarity for future searches [5][9].

### Readiness gate: schedule the first interview
Proceed to the first interview only when the pipeline skews toward referred and targeted prospects, outreach response rates are healthy, SLAs are being met, and performance objectives are stable and understood by interviewers [1][8]. Crossing this gate early prevents wasted interviews, protects candidate experience, and sets up the book’s later interview stages to work as intended [2][3].
