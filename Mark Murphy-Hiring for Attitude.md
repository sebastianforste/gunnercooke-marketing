Mark Murphy-Hiring for Attitude up to (but not including) the first interview, focusing on how to define the attitudes that predict success in your culture, construct role definitions and hiring artifacts around those attitudes, and build a pre‑interview pipeline that screens in high‑fit candidates before any questioning begins [1][2]. It draws on Leadership IQ’s research about failure modes in new hires and the book’s culture‑anchored approach so interviewers enter selection already aligned on what “the right attitude” looks like in practice for your team [3][2].

### Why attitude dominates outcomes
Murphy’s central claim is empirical: 46% of newly hired employees fail within 18 months, and 89% of those failures are due to attitudinal issues rather than lack of technical skill, which reframes hiring as primarily an attitude selection problem, not a skills screening problem [3][4]. This is because coachability, emotional intelligence, motivation, and temperament govern whether skills are applied, improved, and sustained in your specific environment, while skill deficits alone account for only a small fraction of early flameouts [5][6].

### What “attitude” means here
In this framework, attitude is a cluster of observable mindsets and behaviors—especially coachability, emotional intelligence, motivation, and temperament—that predict whether someone will deliver outcomes and thrive in your culture, independent of résumé prestige or tool familiarity [5][7]. The book positions “attitude” as the missing variable leaders instinctively blame in post‑mortems, but rarely define explicitly before a search begins, leading to inconsistent and subjective judgments later [2][3].

### The five failure modes
Murphy’s research groups new‑hire failure into five categories: low coachability, low emotional intelligence, low motivation, mismatched temperament, and insufficient technical competence, with the first four overwhelmingly more prevalent than the last [5][6]. In other words, most bad outcomes are not due to inability to do the tasks but due to how the person learns, relates, persists, and behaves under the real pressures of the job, which are better predicted by attitude than by years of experience [5][3].

### What this file covers
This summary focuses on the pre‑interview build: how to translate company culture into explicit attitude markers, how to encode those into your role definition and hiring artifacts, and how to activate sourcing and qualification approaches that surface attitude‑aligned candidates before the first interview begins [2][3]. It intentionally stops before Murphy’s interview techniques (e.g., coachability probes) that constitute the “first interview” step in the selection sequence [8][2].

### Define the attitudes that matter
Hiring for attitude starts by reverse‑engineering your culture from your top performers to identify the non‑negotiable behaviors and mindsets that make them effective in your specific environment, not in the abstract [6][2]. Practical examples include codifying how your best people handle feedback, conflict, ambiguity, and accountability, which become the “attitude markers” against which all candidates will be screened downstream [6][2].

### Validate with failure analysis
Corroborate those markers against recent mis‑hires and near‑misses to ensure the list addresses real failure modes (e.g., uncoachability or brittle temperament) and not vague personality preferences or brand biases [3][5]. This ties the model to measurable business risks and reduces the likelihood that “culture fit” becomes a proxy for sameness rather than evidence‑based attitude alignment [3][2].

### Convert culture into a rubric
Transform the attitude model into a simple rubric that names each target attitude, lists behaviors that demonstrate it, and flags red‑line behaviors that disqualify regardless of other strengths so that hiring teams can evaluate consistently [9][2]. Keep scales behavior‑anchored (e.g., one‑to‑four without a neutral midpoint) and demand concrete evidence for each rating to minimize “chemistry” bias masquerading as fit [9][3].

### Mission, outcomes, competencies
Borrowing the discipline of outcome‑based role design, pair the attitude rubric with a role definition that states the mission, 3–8 measurable outcomes, and job‑relevant competencies, so “fit” is evidenced by how attitudes enable the specific work to be done [2][10]. This prevents drift into personality labels by keeping all pre‑interview materials tethered to the outcomes the hire must achieve in 12–18 months [2][11].

### Clarify the stakes and constraints
Document the realities that often derail fit—pace, stakeholder complexity, autonomy, customer exposure, travel, time zones, or regulatory constraints—so your attitude model is calibrated to the job’s true environmental demands [2][3]. Being explicit about constraints lets candidates self‑select and lets sourcers target analog environments where similar attitudes have produced success [2][11].

### Craft candidate‑facing narratives
Rewrite the job post and outreach copy to lead with mission, outcomes, and the specific attitudes that matter (e.g., “loves direct feedback and iteration”) rather than generic responsibilities and tool stacks, which is more resonant with the right candidates [2][12]. Clear, human language about what great looks like in year one helps attract those with the desired outlooks and repels candidates misaligned on mindset, saving downstream cycles [12][13].

### Align decision‑makers up front
Before sourcing, circulate the attitude rubric and role definition for sign‑off by the hiring manager and stakeholders so “fit” won’t be redefined midway through the funnel, which damages credibility and velocity [2][3]. This alignment reduces the odds of managers defaulting to skills‑first decisions under time pressure and anchors future choices to the agreed non‑negotiables [2][3].

### Build a referral‑forward channel mix
Because A‑players often know other high performers who share critical mindsets, prioritize referrals and warm introductions alongside targeted outbound to increase the density of attitude‑aligned prospects before interviews begin [2][12]. This sourcing strategy typically yields higher quality and speed than passive posting for roles where attitude is decisive to performance and retention [12][13].

### Map analogous environments
When outbounding, identify companies and roles that cultivate the same attitudes you need—e.g., fast‑iteration product orgs for coachability, or high‑touch service brands for emotional intelligence—to improve portability of success [2][11]. This context mapping ties sourcing lists to the behavioral realities of work, not just title matches, raising the odds that candidates will thrive in your setting [2][11].

### Calibrate titles as signals
Use titles that accurately signal scope and accountability to the market you’re targeting so that the right candidates recognize the challenge and the wrong ones self‑select out early [14][13]. This avoids mis‑set expectations that later manifest as attitude misfit (e.g., ownership tolerance) during ramp, which the research shows is a frequent source of failure [3][14].

### Set pre‑interview SLAs
Publish internal service‑level expectations for response times, feedback cycles, and scheduling windows so your process communicates reliability and respect—early indicators of cultural compatibility for candidates who prize clarity [12][13]. Operational excellence in these small things signals the values you intend to hire for and preserves pipeline momentum before the first conversation [12][13].

### Screen for attitude signals before calls
Use application prompts or short work‑sample questions that elicit evidence of your core attitudes—for example, a brief scenario requiring feedback iteration—to qualify interest and fit before scheduling [2][12]. Keep these light‑weight and directly tied to the role’s outcomes so they function as high‑signal gates rather than bureaucratic hurdles [12][13].

### Coach hiring managers on fit vs. sameness
Educate interviewers on the difference between attitude alignment (behavioral evidence tied to values and outcomes) and “people like us,” which inflates similarity bias and undermines diversity without improving performance [9][3]. Provide examples of evidence‑based ratings and require written rationales to make accountability for “fit” judgments explicit and auditable [9][3].

### Pre‑interview artifacts to finalize
By the time interviews would begin, teams should have a signed attitude rubric, an outcome‑based role definition, candidate‑facing narratives, a target map for outbound, referral activation plans, and a simple tracker tying each prospect to the rubric [2][12]. With these artifacts, the first interview can focus on verifying evidence rather than renegotiating what “the right person” means, which lifts decision quality [2][11].

### Metrics to monitor before interviews
Track the attitude‑aligned share of pipeline by source, response rates to personalized outreach, time‑to‑first‑response, and drop‑offs at any pre‑interview gate to identify friction and noise early [12][13]. A referral‑heavy, high‑response pipeline anchored in your defined attitudes predicts smoother interviews and higher acceptance rates later [12][13].

### Why this pre‑work pays off
Because nearly nine out of ten early failures are attitudinal, front‑loading clarity about attitudes and designing the funnel around them increases the probability of long‑term success more than incremental skills filtering would [3][5]. It also accelerates cycle time by reducing late‑stage rejections for “fit” and compresses ramp risk by selecting people predisposed to thrive in your environment [3][2].

### Case signals from exemplars
The book references companies like Southwest Airlines and The Ritz‑Carlton to illustrate how explicit, operationalized values steer selection and sustain service outcomes, reinforcing the link between attitude and performance at scale [2]. Such examples underscore that attitude isn’t soft—it is the operating system that determines whether skills translate into consistent customer and financial results [2].

### Avoid common traps
Common traps include defaulting to tool checklists, leaving “fit” undefined, and allowing multiple versions of success to circulate among interviewers, each of which raises variance and bias [2][3]. Another is “resume halo,” overweighting brand names or tenure without evidence of the target attitudes in analogous contexts, which contributes to portability failures [2][3].

### Calibrate payout and expectations
Where attitudes are rare and decisive, be prepared to calibrate compensation, progression clarity, and autonomy to market realities so you are not asking for high‑end behavioral traits at mid‑market price points [2][11]. Setting this alignment before interviews keeps messaging honest and reduces close‑stage surprises that erode trust and acceptance [2][12].

### Prepare interview teams without content
Before launching the first interview, reviewers should rehearse how to map evidence to the attitude rubric, agree on disqualifying red flags, and align on handoff criteria between stages, even if question scripts are discussed later [9][2]. This primes the team to gather structured evidence and maintain consistency from the first touchpoint onward [9][2].

### Continuous improvement loop
As hires land, revisit the rubric and role definition to judge predictive validity, updating behaviors and weights if certain signals proved more telling of success or failure in your environment [3][2]. Treat the model as a living artifact between searches but keep it stable during a given search to avoid confusing candidates and interviewers [3][2].

### Where interviews begin (and this file ends)
Murphy’s method proceeds into structured interviews—most famously, coachability and attitude‑evidence probes designed to prevent “voodoo” interviewing—but those mechanics constitute the first interview and beyond, and are out of scope here by design [8][2]. With attitude defined, artifacts aligned, and pipeline tuned, you are now positioned to start the first interview with clarity and leverage rather than guesswork [2][3].

### Practical pre‑interview checklist
- Attitude rubric finalized from top‑performer analysis and recent failure modes, with red‑line disqualifiers [6][3].  
- Outcome‑based role definition complete: mission, 3–8 measurable outcomes, job‑relevant competencies [2][10].  
- Candidate‑facing narrative and outreach templates centered on mission, outcomes, and target attitudes [12][13].  
- Channel plan active: referrals prioritized, target map of analogous environments for outbound [12][11].  
- SLAs and governance defined for responsiveness, scheduling, and decision authority [12][13].  
- Tracker in place linking each prospect to attitude evidence before scheduling any interviews [2][3].

### Signals you are ready to schedule
A healthy share of prospects come from referrals or targeted outbound from analogous environments, responses to personalized outreach are strong, and stakeholders can articulate the top attitudes and outcomes from memory [12][11]. When these conditions hold, the first interview will function as a high‑signal evidence check rather than a fishing expedition, increasing accuracy and speed [12][2].

### Notes on sources and provenance
Leadership IQ’s published research provides the statistical foundation—46% failure within 18 months and 89% of failures due to attitude—anchoring the book’s thesis in longitudinal data across thousands of managers and hires [3][4]. The O’Reilly overview and practitioner summaries support the culture‑anchored framing, case exemplars, and the practical orientation toward rubrics and artifacts before interviews begin [2][5].
